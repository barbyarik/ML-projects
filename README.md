This repository contains code, analytics and other data dedicated to the study of 
various approaches in machine learning using the example of real projects. 
There are both separate directories with projects, and notebooks containing research on a topic. 
Have fun exploring! :eyes:

List of completed projects:

* Airy solution PINN project — The project is dedicated to solving the Airy differential equation using neural networks.
* Telco Churn Prediction — A study of the dataset of the churn of customers of a telecommunications company, including 
detailed exploratory data analysis, machine learning and the creation of a model to predict churn.
* Walmart Sales Forecasting — A study of the dataset of sales at Walmart stores over several years, including both 
direct and indirect factors. The notebook contains a exploratory analysis, the use of machine learning methods and time series theory to predict future sales figures.
