This repository contains code, analytics and other data dedicated to the study of 
various approaches in machine learning using the example of real projects. 
There are both separate directories with projects, and notebooks containing research on a topic. 
Have fun exploring! :eyes:

List of completed projects:

* **Airy solution PINN project** — The project is dedicated to solving the Airy differential equation using neural networks.
* **Telco Churn Prediction** — A study of the dataset of the churn of customers of a telecommunications company, including 
detailed exploratory data analysis, machine learning and the creation of a model to predict churn.
* **Walmart Sales Forecasting** — A study of the dataset of sales at Walmart stores over several years, including both 
direct and indirect factors. The notebook contains a exploratory analysis, the use of machine learning methods and time series theory to predict future sales figures.
* **Sentiment analysis** — There is more than one way to explore the sentiment of a message. This project presents five different methods to accomplish this task. It 
includes the use of the ```NLTK``` library, ```Text Blob```, as well as ```HuggingFace``` ```BERT``` and ```RoBERTa``` models.
* **Automatic Number Plate Recognition** is a technology that uses optical character recognition in images to read vehicle registration plates to create vehicle location 
data. There are two versions implemented in this project: a lightweight one (in the form of an ```ipynb``` file) and a full-fledged one that reads the license plate from the 
video and creates a video displaying the recognized license plate.
* **Mayakovsky Network** — a project that performs the task of text generation. In this case, it generates "poems" in the style of 
Vladimir Mayakovsky, recurrent neural network and ```GPT-Neo``` model from ```HuggingFace``` are used to complete the task.
